Workout Tracker (Tailwind + Font Awesome)

This is a single static HTML page that reproduces a workout tracker UI using Tailwind CSS (CDN) and Font Awesome icons.

How to open

- Open `src/index.html` in your browser. No build step required because Tailwind is loaded from the CDN.

Notes

- For production, consider installing Tailwind and purging unused CSS instead of using the CDN.
- Font Awesome Free is used via CDN; ensure network access when loading the page.
